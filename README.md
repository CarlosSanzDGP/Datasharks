Is a general belief that sharks are one of the most dangerous animals on Earth. Despite the gruesome of this attacks, if we track the data we reach the conclusion that this is not true at all, in fact, the mosquitos are the real danger we should take care of. But, how many people is really injured and dead after a shark attack? Are there any curiosity abour this numbers. Let's check it.  

The main hipothesis of this proyect is confirming the my personal idea that sharks are less dangerous than stupidity. For that reason we have checked the number of deaths "because of selfies", what in my opinion is the undisputed maximun of stupidity. 


## Methodology

We are going to use the data set of Kaggle about sharks, what in a first momment have to be "cleaned" carefully. For that we are going to pandas and numpy, tryng to obtain a clear table where we could have real and interesting facts.
